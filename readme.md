# OSSint — An Open Source Intelligence Tool That Actually Makes Sense
OSSint is a simple, no-nonsense tool for gathering open source intelligence. It helps you search for usernames, domains, emails, and IP addresses across different services — without getting in your way.

The idea is to keep things modular and flexible. You can use it as-is, or add your own modules depending on what you're trying to dig up. Whether you're doing research, investigating something, or just playing around, OSSint gives you the building blocks to find useful info fast.
